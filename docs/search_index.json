For example: 42 + 17 ## [1] 59 sqrt(243) ## [1] 15.58846 1.56*1233 ## [1] 1923.48 7.21*8^4 ## [1] 29532.16 For more complicated mathematical operations, it is useful to store intermediate values in named variables. x &lt;- (42 + 17)*sqrt(43) y &lt;- 7.21*8^4 + log(2.34) z &lt;- x/y z ## print out the value of z ## [1] 0.01310022 Here, x, y, and z are examples of variables. The pair of characters &lt;- used together is known as the assignment operator in R. x &lt;- 2 assigns the value 2 to the variable x. 1.2 Variables in R "],["the-pool-of-tears.html", "Chapter 2 The pool of tears", " Chapter 2 The pool of tears "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
