## Using R as a calculator

You can use R as a basic **calculator**. 

For example:

```{r, echo=TRUE}
42 + 17 

sqrt(243)

1.56*1233

7.21*8^4
```



For more complicated mathematical operations, it is useful to
store intermediate values in **named variables**.

```{r, echo=TRUE}
x <- (42 + 17)*sqrt(43)
y <- 7.21*8^4 + log(2.34)
z <- x/y
z  ## print out the value of z
```

Here, `x`, `y`, and `z` are examples of **variables**.

The pair of characters `<-` used together is known as the **assignment operator** in **R**.
`x <- 2` assigns the value `2` to the variable `x`.
